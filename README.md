# Bluemax+ for Commodore 64

This project integrates a SNES PETSCII robot interface with the classic Bluemax game on the Commodore 64. It combines the original game code with additional features, such as rudder control, speed adjustment, and more. Note that this project does not include the full game; you'll need the original Bluemax game to build this modified version.

## Features

- **Rudder Control**: Use the SNES controller to control the plane's rudder.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the plane's speed on the Y axis with the SNES controller.
- **Bomb Control**: Disable bomb drop when pressing down + fire.
- **Gun Sway**: Added gun sway with rudder control.

## SNES Controller

An SNES controller adapter is required to use the SNES controller with the Commodore 64. You can purchase one from Texelec. Ensure that you use a high-quality SNES controller, as some cheaper versions may not work correctly.

### SNES Control Overview

| Button        | Function in Bluemax (In-Game) | Function in Bluemax (Menu/Combo)         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Button 2      | Downspeed                     |                                          |
| Button 0      | Fire / Unpause                |                                          |
| Select        |                               | Enter options (F3) / Change options (F5) / Pause |
| Start         | Start / Reset (F7)            |                                          |
| Up            | Up                            |                                          |
| Down          | Down                          |                                          |
| Left          | Left                          |                                          |
| Right         | Right                         |                                          |
| Button 1      | Bomb                          |                                          |
| Snes X        | Upspeed                       | Pause (Select + X)                       |
| Left Select   | Rudder Left                   | Enter options (F3) with Select           |
| Right Select  | Rudder Right                  | Change options (F5) with Select          |

## Known Issues

- **Shortened Theme Song**: The theme song is shortened to make space for the additional code, which omits the "MUSIC PROGRAMMED BY STEPHEN C BIGGS" credit.
- **Gun Sway on Air Targets**: The gun sway feature works well on ground targets but is less effective on air targets.
- **Bomb Drop in Demo**: The demo may not drop bombs due to the bomb drop + down disable feature.

## Cheat and Feature Enabling

You can enable cheats or features by using a poke to address `30` before running the game:

- `0x01 (1)`: Disables bomb drop when Down + Fire is pressed.
- `0x02 (2)`: Enables unlimited bombs.
- `0x04 (4)`: Enables unlimited fuel.
- `0x08 (8)`: Enables unlimited damage (invulnerability).
- `0x10 (16)`: Disables plane lowscreen adjust limit.

**Examples**:
- `Poke 30,0`: Only disables bomb drop when Down + Fire is pressed.
- `Poke 30,14`: Enables all cheats + disables bomb drop when Down + Fire.
- `Poke 30,17`: Disables all extra functions.

## Quick Build (Windows)

1. Get all files from this repository in a folder (e.g., `G:\My Drive\C64\C64projects\BlueMax\bluemax\v10`).
2. Install Vice 32-bit.
